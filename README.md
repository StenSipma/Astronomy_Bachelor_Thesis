# Astronomy Bachelor Thesis
Code which I used for my Bachelor's Thesis in Astronomy for the University of Groningen.

The `Aurigaia - *` notebooks contain code used to get Aurigaia data (from SQL interface, or when downloaded locally). The other notebooks contain exploratory code and code used to produce the results.

The `aurigaia` directory contains a local package mainly written by Tom Callingam (adapted from [this repo](https://github.com/jchelly/aurigaia-examples)), and slightly adapted for this thesis. It can be installed using `pip install -e .` when you are located in the `aurigaia` subdirectory.
